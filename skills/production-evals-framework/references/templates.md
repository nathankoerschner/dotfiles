# Eval Artifact Templates

Use these templates as starting points. Rename fields as needed for your domain.

## 1) Golden Set (`golden_data.yaml`)

```yaml
version: "1.0"
description: "Curated baseline checks"

test_cases:
  - id: "gs-001"
    category: "knowledge"
    query: "What is our refund policy?"
    expected_tools: ["vector_search"]
    expected_sources: ["refund_policy.md"]
    must_contain: ["30 days", "annual plan"]
    must_not_contain: ["I don't know"]
```

## 2) Labeled Scenarios (`scenarios.yaml`)

```yaml
version: "1.0"
description: "Coverage-focused scenario suite"

scenarios:
  single_tool:
    vector_only:
      - id: "sc-v-001"
        query: "What is our PTO policy?"
        expected_tools: ["vector_search"]
        difficulty: "straightforward"
        must_contain: ["PTO"]

  multi_tool:
    docs_and_sql:
      - id: "sc-m-001"
        query: "What is our refund policy and how many refunds were processed last quarter?"
        expected_tools: ["vector_search", "sql_query"]
        difficulty: "straightforward"
        must_contain: ["refund", "last quarter"]

  edge_cases:
    off_topic:
      - id: "sc-e-001"
        query: "What's the weather today?"
        expected_tools: []
        difficulty: "edge_case"
        must_contain: ["I can help with"]
```

## 3) Replay Session Fixture (`fixtures/<session-id>.json`)

Use this as a recorded session artifact for analysis and cross-version comparison.
It does not imply deterministic mock/no-live replay unless explicitly requested.

```json
{
  "session_id": "refund_policy_20260226_101500",
  "query": "What is our refund policy and count in Q4?",
  "response": "Final answer text...",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool_name": "vector_search", "arguments": {"query": "refund policy"}, "result": ""},
    {"tool_name": "sql_query", "arguments": {"query": "refunds in q4"}, "result": ""}
  ],
  "retrieved_sources": ["refund_policy.md"],
  "source_contents": [],
  "timestamp": "2026-02-26T10:15:00Z",
  "annotations": {
    "relevant_sources": ["refund_policy.md"],
    "expected_tools": ["vector_search", "sql_query"],
    "expected_facts": ["30-day refund window", "8 refunds in Q4"]
  }
}
```

## 4) Rubrics (`rubrics.yaml`)

```yaml
version: "1.0"

  relevance:
    weight: 0.25
    description: "How directly the response answers the query"

category_weights:
  compliance:
    accuracy: 0.45
    relevance: 0.20
    completeness: 0.25
    clarity: 0.10

test_cases:
  - id: "rb-001"
    query: "What is our refund policy?"
    category: "compliance"
    expected_sources: ["refund_policy.md"]
```

## 5) Variants (`variants.yaml`)

```yaml
defaults:
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
  temperature: 0.1
  max_tokens: 1000
  system_prompt: "v1"
  tools: ["vector_search", "sql_query", "ticket_search", "chat_search"]

variants:
  baseline:
    description: "Current production baseline"
    model: "gpt-4o-mini"
    temperature: 0.1
    system_prompt: "v1"
  prompt_v2:
    description: "Prompt rewrite"
    model: "gpt-4o-mini"
    temperature: 0.1
    system_prompt: "v2"
  model_upgrade:
    description: "Larger model"
    model: "gpt-4o"
    temperature: 0.1
    system_prompt: "v1"

prompts:
  v1: |
    You are an assistant. Be concise and accurate.
  v2: |
    You are an assistant. Prioritize factual grounding, explicit sourcing, and concise direct answers.
```

## 6) Experiment Result Row (`results/<variant>_<timestamp>.json`)

```json

  "variant": "baseline",
  "config": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "temperature": 0.1},
  "results": [
    {
      "case_id": "gs-001",
      "query": "What is our refund policy?",
      "response": "Answer text...",
      "passed": true,
      "rubric_score": 4.2,
