I want to build a tool using hammerspoon. What I would like for it to do is every 15 minutes where my computer is open, give me a prompt asking what I spent the last 15 minutes doing.
When I respond to the prompt, it should create a calendar entry with that information as the title
When the prompt pops up, it should also show the title of the previous calendar entry
