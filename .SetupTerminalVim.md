# How to create a TerminalVim.app
    Open Automator
    Choose "New Document"
    Locate "Run AppleScript" and double-click it
    Paste the Applescript code into the box
    Save as /Applications/TerminalVim.app
    In Finder, select some file you want to open in Vim, e.g. a .rb file.
    Hit ⌘I to open the “Get Info” window.
    Under “Open with:”, choose TerminalVim.app. You may need to select “Other…” and then browse.
    Hit the “Change All…” button and confirm.

Now all .rb files in Finder will open in Vim.



```
on run {input, parameters}
	-- Check if the input is not empty and is a valid file
	if input is not equal to "" then
		try
			-- Convert the input to a POSIX path
			set filePath to POSIX path of input
			set quotedFilePath to quoted form of filePath
			
			-- Commands to run in Terminal
			tell application "Terminal"
				activate
				-- Open a new window and execute the commands
				do script "clear"
				do script "cd `dirname " & quotedFilePath & "`" in front window
				do script "vim " & quotedFilePath in front window
			end tell
		on error errMsg
			display dialog "Error: " & errMsg
		end try
	else
		display dialog "No input file provided."
	end if
end run
```
