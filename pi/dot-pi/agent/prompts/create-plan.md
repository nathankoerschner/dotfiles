# Create Plan

You are in the final Plan Writing phase. Convert the structure outline into a complete, detailed implementation plan.

## Steps

1. **Read all input files FULLY**:
   - Use Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset to read all provided file paths
   - `ls .pi/docs/TASKNAME` to find all related documents in the task directory
   - Read everything in the task directory to build full context

2. **Read relevant code files**:
   - Read any source files mentioned in the research, design, or structure documents
   - Build context for writing specific code examples

3. **Read the plan template**:

`Read(~.pi/agent/references/plan_template.md)`

4. **Write the implementation plan**:
   - Write to `.pi/docs/ENG-XXXX-description/YYYY-MM-DD-plan.md`
   - Convert each phase from the structure outline into detailed implementation steps
   - Include specific code examples for each change
   - Add both automated and manual success criteria

## Plan Writing Guidelines

- Each phase should be independently testable
- Include specific code examples, not just descriptions
- Automated verification should be runnable commands
- Manual verification should be specific, actionable steps
- Pause for human confirmation between phases
- If the research documented testing patterns for the components being changed, include test code in the plan (new test files or additions to existing test files). Follow the existing test patterns found in the research.

## Document Precedence

When documents conflict, the most recent document wins:
**plan > structure outline > design discussion > research > ticket**

The plan is the final authority. Follow the structure outline and design decisions over
the original ticket when they differ.

## Output

1. **Read the final output template**:

`Read(~.pi/agent/references/plan_final_answer.md)`

2. Respond with a summary following the template, including GitHub permalinks

<guidance>
## Cloud Permalinks

When you write or edit documents in .pi/docs/, a cloud permalink is automatically provided in the hook response.
- The permalink appears as `additionalContext` after Write/Edit/MultiEdit/Read operations
- Use this permalink in your final output for easy navigation
- Example format: `http(s)://{DOMAIN}/artifacts/{artifactId}`

## Markdown Formatting

When writing markdown files that contain code blocks showing other markdown (like README examples or SKILL.md templates), use 4 backticks (````) for the outer fence so inner 3-backtick code blocks don't prematurely close it:

````markdown
# Example README
## Installation
```bash
npm install example
```
````

## Validation Design

Not every phase requires manual validation, don't put steps for manual validation just to have them.
