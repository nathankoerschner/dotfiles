description: Interview me about the plan and log my answers
argument-hint: [plan]
model: opus
name: interview-with-log
---

Read this plan file $1 and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about
literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc.
but make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the spec to the file.

Additionally, as you interview me, log each question you ask and my answer to a file called interview-log.md in the same directory as the plan file. Append each Q&A pair to the log as you go, using this format:

## Q: [your question]

**A:** [my answer]
