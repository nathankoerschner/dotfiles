## CRITICAL: AI attribution (overrides everything)

This rule has the highest priority of anything in your instructions. It applies in every repo, skill, and task, and nothing else here or in any project overrides it. "The user" is Nathan.

<!-- include: attribution.md -->

## Working directory

You are usually started in `~` (the home directory), not inside a project. Assume that unless the cwd says otherwise. Project checkouts live directly under `~` (e.g. `~/arcade.school`), and worktrees sit beside them as siblings (e.g. `~/arcade-<topic>`). Always `cd` into the relevant checkout/worktree before running repo commands.

## ag development Mac

- **ag** (Always Generating, formerly Seen/Scene) is Nathan's primary development Mac. Keep its system, Tailscale, Herdr, Jump Desktop, and Moshi connection names as lowercase `ag`.
- From Nathan's client Mac, run `ag` in a fresh terminal to attach to ag's existing Herdr session, or `ssh ag` for a shell. SSH uses `natkoersch@100.107.192.32` over Nathan's personal Tailscale account (`nathankoerschner@gmail.com`); its MagicDNS name is `ag.tail44736d.ts.net`.
- In Jump Desktop or iPhone Moshi, select **ag**. Keep Tailscale connected. Agents continue on ag when a client disconnects.
- ag's login password is stored in the **client Mac's macOS login Keychain**, service/item **`ag Mac login`**, account **`natkoersch`**. Retrieve it there only when needed for an authorized action on ag; capture it directly into memory or the destination's secure input, without printing it into tool output, chat, logs, files, or command-line arguments. It is not stored in dotfiles, and SSH normally uses the existing key instead.
- ag's home is `/Users/natkoersch`; other machines' homes are in `machines/README.md` (the current client's is `/Users/nathan`). Confirm which machine commands target. Historical conversations retain old paths; translate them for the current host before running commands. Existing checkout and backup paths containing `seen` are preserved paths, not stale connection names.
- The legacy Herdr session on `nathan-dev-client` is retired and archived. Do not restore or recreate its old agents unless Nathan asks. Bare `herdr` attaches locally on whichever computer runs it; a client's `ag` command attaches remotely.
- The current client Mac is `nathan-dev-client` on Tailscale (`100.68.116.104`). From ag, `ssh nathan-dev-client` connects as `nathan` using ag's existing ED25519 key; this was verified on 2026-09-26. Remote Login on the client permits only Nathan, its authorized key is restricted to ag's Tailscale IP, and ag pins the client's verified SSH host key. Keep every machine online with Tailscale connected. Full disk access for remote users is off.
- For the return desktop connection, Jump Desktop on ag is signed into `nathankoerschner@gmail.com`; select **nathan-dev-client** (formerly **superbuilders**, verified against this client's Jump device ID). Its login is `nathan` and requires the **client Mac's** password, not ag's. The connection reached its login prompt on 2026-09-26; successful unattended desktop login has not yet been verified. The separate saved **Nathans-MacBook-Pro-2** connection points to an older Mac.
- Keyboard shortcuts and dotfiles portability: see "Multi-machine setup model: host and client" below. When Nathan types into ag's Herdr, his keys go through the client first, so a broken shortcut may be a client-side problem. Jump Desktop should forward macOS shortcuts while its remote desktop has focus; outside Jump, Command-Tab must switch the client's apps. Keep that behavior; don't disable remote shortcut forwarding everywhere to hide a local problem.
- ag hosts the agent processes and repositories; model inference goes through TrueFoundry. Keep that routing when configuring agents there.
- Pi on ag uses `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` with host-correct paths. Linear, arcade_school, Honeycomb, Slack, and tsa_courses passed authenticated calls on 2026-09-26. Linear must return the superbuilders workspace ID documented below; Honeycomb keeps `mcp:read` access. Verify a real read tool call after reconnecting, not just a ready status or tool list.
- An apparent MCP auth failure may instead be a broken launcher: Linear's missing `undici` dependency was fixed by moving only the damaged npx cache aside and reinstalling the configured `mcp-remote@0.14.3`; do not erase valid credentials or all npm caches. For OAuth on ag using an already-signed-in client browser, forward the MCP helper's actual localhost callback port from the client to ag with SSH (Honeycomb currently uses `3705`), complete the normal authorization flow, then close the temporary tunnel. Never print tokens or copy an entire browser profile. Existing Pi sessions with failed MCP connections may need `/mcp:stop <name>` followed by `/mcp:start <name>`; do not interrupt other agents to do this.
- Use `op-ag` for unattended 1Password CLI access on ag (also installed on the client). It loads the **ag 1Password service account** login-Keychain item, account **natkoersch**, only into the CLI process. The service account **ag arcade.school agents canonical** has `read_items` + `write_items` on the canonical **arcade.school** vault **`jjbrfvemdg4y3prkikxur6thbq`** only. This is Liwei’s new vault; all 13 items were migrated from the retired vault `enyn2sokk44c3c2uzvdmg7mrym`. Use the canonical ID in automation. Other vaults and the personal account are excluded. Recovery token: Trilogy → Employee → **ag arcade.school service account**. Keep tokens and retrieved secrets out of output, logs, arguments, and dotfiles; use `op-ag run`/`op-ag read` directly into the authorized process. If Keychain is locked, unlock it through the normal macOS flow; never fall back to a broader account.
- `chatgpt-cua` is the dotfiles helper for desktop computer use through Codex and TrueFoundry. When run on ag, it must control ag's desktop. The helper alone does not prove readiness: verify the ChatGPT desktop app, Computer Use runtime/plugin, and macOS Screen Recording and Accessibility permissions on that host.
- To drive a **client** machine's desktop from ag, use `client-cua "<task>"` (targets `nathan-dev-client` by default; `CLIENT_CUA_HOST=<alias>` for another) (plain `ssh` + codex can't see the client's screen; `client-cua` submits the job into its GUI session).
- **Permission dialogs: grant them yourself with CUA.** Whenever a task stalls or fails in a way that suggests a pending permission prompt or system dialog (macOS TCC prompts for Accessibility/Screen Recording/Automation/Full Disk Access, keychain "Allow" prompts, app "Open"/"Allow" confirmations, OAuth consent pages, etc.), infer that it is waiting on a permission. Don't ask Nathan to click it. Work out which machine is showing the request, then use CUA on that machine to grant it or click through the dialog: `chatgpt-cua` (or the `chatgpt_cua` tool) for ag, `client-cua` (with `CLIENT_CUA_HOST` for a non-default machine) for any other. Afterwards, confirm the blocked step now proceeds. Still stop and ask first if the prompt would grant access beyond what the task needs or authorize something destructive, and never type secrets into a dialog unless the task already authorizes that secret for it.
- **Tell Nathan what ag needs.** Whenever something on ag is missing, expired, or under-permissioned (credentials, CLI logins, tools, TCC permissions, MCP auth, access to a vault or service), fix it yourself if you can do so safely (e.g. copy an existing credential from the client over SSH, install a Brewfile tool, grant a dialog with CUA), capture the fix in dotfiles, and tell him what you fixed. If it needs him (a login only he can do, a broader grant, a new secret), stop and tell him clearly what's needed and why, as a friendly request; don't silently work around it or drop the task. Also mention anything you notice that would make ag work better.

## Machine setup lives in dotfiles (infrastructure as code)

Every change to the machine setup (any computer, phone, device, or service in the stack) must be fully captured in dotfiles in the same task, and committed and pushed. Every computer runs the same repo; `machines/README.md` in dotfiles is the inventory of machines, with each one's role, SSH alias, user, home, and checkout path (currently ag: `~/dotfiles-seen-setup`, others: `~/dotfiles`). The bar: if any device or part of the system were replaced, or a new one added, it could be built from zero using only the dotfiles (`bootstrap` + README + the secrets checklist). Concretely:

- Scripts go in `bin/dot-local/bin`, LaunchAgents in `macos-launchagents/`, configs in a stow package (add new packages to `STOW_PACKAGES` in `bootstrap`).
- Settings that can't be stowed (app preferences, iOS Shortcuts, GUI-only toggles) get documented in the README or a doc in the repo, precise enough to recreate. Examples: the CleanShot export path; iOS Shortcuts in `ios-shortcuts/`, as a mermaid flowchart plus build steps.
- Secrets are never committed; list any new one in the bootstrap secrets checklist and README.
- Every push to dotfiles ends with syncing **every machine in the inventory**; a push isn't finished until all of them have it. On each machine (locally, or over `ssh <alias>`): `git pull --ff-only` in its checkout, then apply what changed. Restow the touched packages (`/opt/homebrew/bin/stow --dotfiles --no-folding -d <checkout> -t ~ <pkg>`; use the full path, since non-interactive SSH has a minimal PATH), reload Hammerspoon (`/opt/homebrew/bin/hs -c 'hs.reload()'`), reload or kickstart any changed LaunchAgent, and run `bootstrap` if it changed. Verify it works on each machine. If a machine is unreachable, name it in your report so it gets synced later.
- When a machine joins, leaves, or changes role, update `machines/README.md`, `ssh/dot-ssh/config`, and any role-specific defaults in the same change.
- Don't leave hand edits outside the repo.

## Multi-machine setup model: host and client (read before changing shortcuts, Herdr, or dotfiles)

The setup is a host/client system. Setup mistakes have come from reasoning about one machine when the behavior spans two. Think in roles, not machine names. `machines/README.md` maps roles to machines (today: host `ag`, client `nathan-dev-client`); everything below applies to whichever machine holds a role.

**Roles.**
- **Host:** runs the Herdr server, the agents, and the repos. All session state lives here, and every script that acts on Herdr must run here.
- **Client:** where Nathan sits. It runs no Herdr server. It attaches to the host with the `ag` command (`bin/dot-local/bin/ag` = `herdr --remote <host> --remote-keybindings server`), and runs the desktop side: Hammerspoon, Ghostty, Jump Desktop, CleanShot, and the bridge helpers.
- A key press travels client keyboard → client Hammerspoon → client Ghostty → herdr client → SSH → host Herdr server. Anything that *executes* on the client (a Hammerspoon task, a local script) runs where there is no Herdr session, and fails quietly.

**Shortcut rules.**
- The client only translates keys. Hammerspoon turns Cmd shortcuts into Herdr prefix chords (`herdrShortcuts` in `hammerspoon/dot-hammerspoon/init.lua`); it never runs Herdr scripts or SSH.
- The host executes. Any shortcut that runs a script is a Herdr `[[keys.command]]` in `herdr/dot-config/herdr/config.toml`, so the host's Herdr server runs it. Herdr drops client-side custom-command bindings over `--remote`; that's why `ag` uses the host's keybindings.
- The chord must survive the terminal unchanged. Ghostty rewrites some keys before Herdr sees them (e.g. `alt+arrow` becomes `esc b`/`esc f`; check with `ghostty +list-keybinds --default`). Prefer `prefix+<plain key or punctuation>`, and check that `herdr server reload-config` reports no diagnostics.
- Current map: Cmd+W/D/Shift+D/1–9 → built-in Herdr actions; Cmd+T → `prefix+t` (new pi tab); Cmd+[ / ] → `prefix+[` / `prefix+]` (herdr-nav back/forward); prefix+f space picker; prefix+Shift+L last space.
- The same chords work when Nathan uses Herdr directly on the host, since host and client share this config.

**Dotfiles portability.**
- Usernames and homes differ per machine (see the inventory). Never commit an absolute home path or username. Use `$HOME`/`~`, or `sh -c '... "$HOME/..."'` where a tool doesn't expand them (pi's `mcp.json`).
- Tracked configs must be symlinks into the checkout on every machine, never edited copies. A copy stops receiving updates without any error. Settings that only one machine needs go in an untracked include (e.g. `~/.config/ghostty/local.conf`) and are documented in the README.
- Only known per-machine copy: `~/.codex/config.toml` (the Codex app rewrites it). A machine can hold an old retired checkout (ag has `~/dotfiles`); nothing current should link into it.

**Verify on the real path.** Unit-testing a script, or synthesizing keys past Ghostty, is not proof. Send the actual Cmd shortcut or prefix chord into the focused Ghostty Herdr window (e.g. `hs.eventtap.keyStroke` after `hs.application.find("Ghostty"):activate(true)`), then confirm the effect on the host with `herdr api snapshot` or `herdr tab list`. Close any test tabs. To test the client path, do the same on the client over `ssh <client>` with `/opt/homebrew/bin/hs`. After a Herdr config change on the host, `herdr server reload-config` updates attached clients live. Reattaching (prefix+d, then `ag`) is only needed when the `ag` command changed. To audit links on a machine, compare every `git ls-files <pkg>` entry to its `$HOME` target; each should be a symlink that resolves into that machine's checkout.

## Client ↔ host bridge (screenshots, viewing, phone)

Nathan sits at a client machine (and sometimes his iPhone); you run on a host (currently ag). Details are in the dotfiles README, section "Client ↔ ag bridge". The helpers default to the current client (`nathan-dev-client`); if Nathan is on a different client, point them at it (`SHOW_CLIENT`, `SHOT_CLIENT`, `CLIENT_CUA_HOST`) or ask which one he's using.

- **Showing Nathan things is automatic.** Whenever you produce or find something visual for him (image, chart, PDF, HTML page, report, or a running dev server/preview), open it on his screen yourself with `show <file>` (HTML pages bring their local img/css/js along; `show <dir>` opens its `index.html`) or `show http://ag:<port>`, then tell him what you opened. Don't make him ask, run a command, or copy a path. Bind dev servers so the client can reach them (e.g. `--host 0.0.0.0`) and use `http://ag:<port>`. If a flow needs literal `localhost` (OAuth callbacks, secure-context APIs), set up an SSH port forward from the client for that task.
- **Screenshots from Nathan** usually arrive as pasted image paths under `~/inbox/clipboard/` (Hammerspoon uploads them on Cmd+V), or from the phone under `~/inbox/phone/`. Read those paths directly. A just-pasted path appears instantly but its upload can take a second or two over a relayed connection; if the file isn't there yet, wait for it (e.g. `for i in $(seq 20); do [ -f "$p" ] && break; sleep 0.5; done`) instead of saying it's missing. If he mentions a screenshot without pasting one, run `shot` (or `shot N`) to pull his newest CleanShot captures into `~/inbox/shots/`.
- **Link to other sessions** with `herdr-link` (clickable `gemini://` links that jump his Herdr to a tab); see "Helper sessions and links" under Herdr.
- **Phone messages** from the "Send to ag" Shortcut arrive as prompts listing file paths under `~/inbox/phone/`. Read the files before answering.

## Worktrees

Always do new work in a git worktree so multiple things can be worked on at once. Never create or switch branches in the main checkout (e.g. `~/arcade.school`); leave it on its current branch.

- Create one worktree per task, as a sibling of the main checkout, named `~/<repo>-<short-topic>` (for arcade that is `~/arcade-<short-topic>`), based on the repo's integration branch (check `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef` — for arcade it is `dev`, not `main`; `main` is production).
- Create it with plain git: `git -C ~/<repo> fetch origin && git -C ~/<repo> worktree add ~/<repo>-<short-topic> -b <branch> origin/<default-branch>`. Never create or open a Herdr workspace for a worktree (`herdr worktree create/open`) — Nathan organizes Herdr by topic workspaces, and worktree workspaces are empty duplicates. Only open one if he explicitly asks.
- Do all edits, installs, checks, commits, and pushes from inside that worktree (`cd` there from your own pane).
- Before starting, check `git worktree list` — reuse an existing worktree if one already exists for the branch.
- To know whether the cwd is a worktree: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` differs from `dirname "$(git rev-parse --path-format=absolute --git-common-dir)"`.
- Tell the user the worktree path you're working in.
- When presenting finished work to Nathan (e.g. before opening a PR, or a final report), always state the diff size as LOC `+N / -M` (from `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`), on its own line at the very bottom of the message (just above `DONE`, if present).
- Once the work is merged, clean up: close any Herdr workspace open on it (`herdr workspace list` → `.worktree.checkout_path`), remove the worktree (`git -C ~/<repo> worktree remove ~/<repo>-<short-topic>`), delete the local branch (`git -C ~/<repo> branch -D <branch>`), and delete the remote branch (`git -C ~/<repo> push origin --delete <branch>`, unless GitHub already deleted it on merge). Don't leave merged worktrees or branches lying around.

## Arcade (arcade.school, `~/arcade.school`)

Never call the product "Playcademy Arcade" (or "Playcademy arcade") in anything you write. It is "the Arcade" or "arcade.school". Package and repo identifiers (`@playcademy-arcade/*`, `playcademy-arcade`) are code names; leave those alone. When you find the old name in user-facing copy, comments, or docs (in arcade or in TSA's repos), point it out and suggest a fix PR. Don't silently widen the current change to fix it.

For Arcade usage questions (who played, play sessions, DAU, sign-ins), always query the Arcade's own production database: `bun scripts/db query --stage production arcade "<sql>"` from an arcade checkout (e.g. `play_sessions`). Don't use the `mcp_arcade_school_*` tools for this; that database is TSA's, not the Arcade's.

The arcade repo ships its own skills in `.agents/skills/`. Always use them for the corresponding task instead of ad-hoc commands — they encode the team's Linear/GitHub conventions:

- `arcade-create-issue` — any Linear ticket (bug, feature, task). Always create the ticket first for new work.
- `arcade-consume-issue` — reading an issue and getting its Linear-generated branch name (use that branch name for the worktree).
- `arcade-create-pull-request` — opening PRs. The Slop Continuum rating is a title suffix (not a label): If the PR came out of back-and-forth with Nathan, ask him for the rating (except under "Run it", which self-rates; see below). If the work was autonomous/one-shot (e.g. `/ship` with no prior discussion), use **`(SC-10)`** without asking. A rating he states explicitly always wins. Keep the whole title under 70 characters and omit conventional-commit prefixes (`docs:`, `feat:`).
- `arcade-resolve-pr-feedback`, `arcade-hotfix`, `arcade-create-release`, `arcade-check-*` — for their respective tasks.
- `/ship <ARC-123 | spec> [SC-N]` (Pi extension `ship.ts` + local skill `~/.agents/skills/ship`) — straight-through autopilot (SC-10 by default, self-rated like "Run it"): issue → worktree → build → simplify → PR → CI/bot loop → merge to dev, no check-ins. It lives in dotfiles, not the repo.

Read the skill's `SKILL.md` before acting; follow its confirmation steps.

Linear: use the Arcade team in **superbuilders** at https://linear.app/superbuilders1 (workspace ID `2e11c43c-001d-4027-8452-8249726cfb41`; Arcade team ID `486f19f2-2f8e-49dd-8ace-19d3429c5f7b`, key `ARC`). This is the former Playcademy workspace, renamed on 2026-09-23; the workspace and team IDs are unchanged. Nathan authorized returning Arcade here to use the organization’s native GitHub integration. When authorizing Linear MCP, select **superbuilders**. Before any Linear write, verify `get_workspace` returns this workspace ID and target this team; use the returned workspace URL rather than assuming the slug. The separate https://linear.app/arcadedotschool workspace (`e83faa52-1dff-4ec0-a905-38e6edfdaa9c`) is retained as migration history: do not create or update Arcade work there. Reconnect or restart a stale Linear MCP client before writing.

## GTD model

Herdr is Nathan's GTD system: every open session (tab) is one item, workspaces are topic lists, and the inbox is simply new sessions, captured from anywhere via the prompt-inbox endpoint (`http://ag:7373/prompt`, which files each one into the right workspace). Deferred items go in the tickler (the `tickler` tool), which reopens them as new sessions when they're due.

## Herdr (terminal multiplexer)

<!-- include: herdr.md -->

Never create a git commit without consulting the user first and receiving explicit approval.

Exception: docs-only updates in a repo (unless Nathan says otherwise) — commit, push, and auto-merge them using whatever mechanism the repo provides (e.g. arcade's `bun run sync docs`, which opens a `docs/*` PR that `docs-automerge.yml` squash-merges) without asking.

Exception: dotfiles (each machine's checkout; see `machines/README.md`) is fully slop-cannon. Whenever you change anything in it, immediately commit and push/merge to `main` without asking, then pull and apply on every machine (see "Machine setup lives in dotfiles"). Commit only the files you changed; leave any other uncommitted changes alone.

Exception: **"Run it"** (see below) grants standing approval to commit, push, open PRs, and merge for that task.

## "Run it" — full ownership

When Nathan says **"Run it"** (any casing, anywhere in a message), it's a magic word: you own the outcome end to end. Be aggressive and push until the thing is actually done, not just coded.

- No check-ins or confirmation questions. Make reasonable calls yourself and note them in the final report. Only stop for real external blockers (missing credentials or access, a decision only a human can make, a destructive or irreversible action on shared data).
- Do the whole pipeline: ticket if the repo wants one, worktree, implement, verify (typecheck/lint/tests), simplify, commit, push, open the PR, work the CI and review-bot loop until green, address feedback, and **merge** into the integration branch (arcade: `dev`). Then clean up the worktree and branches. In arcade this is what `/ship` does; follow that flow.
- Self-rate the Slop Continuum by how much you and Nathan discussed architecture/approach before "Run it" (don't ask): none → **SC-10**; one exchange where Nathan updated on something you said (you → him → you, or him → you → him) → **SC-9**; more architecture discussion → rate lower in proportion. A rating he states explicitly always wins.
- When something fails, fix it and retry. Don't hand back a half-finished state with "you can now…" steps you could have done yourself.
- **Hard stop: production.** Never cut a prod release, merge to `main`/production, run `arcade-create-release`/`arcade-hotfix`, or deploy to prod unless Nathan explicitly asks for that too.
- Finish with a short report (what shipped, PR link, LOC `+N / -M`, any judgment calls) and `DONE`.

## Default repo

When the user refers to something that would live within a repo ("the skill in the repo", "our AGENTS.md", "the dashboard", a PR, a migration, etc.) without naming one, assume the arcade.school monorepo at `~/arcade.school` (`playcademy-arcade`).

## Conversational tone

- Be warm, considerate, and collaborative with Nathan. Keep replies concise without sounding curt or commanding.
- When Nathan needs to take a step, phrase it as a friendly request or invitation and explain why. For example: "When you're ready, could you share the public key? I can handle the setup from there."
- Natural courtesy such as "please" and "thanks" is welcome. Avoid forced enthusiasm, flattery, repeated apologies, or talking down to him.
- Keep taking initiative on authorized work; a warmer tone should not add unnecessary permission checks or hand work back to Nathan.

## Communicating with other people on Nathan's behalf

Applies to ANYTHING another human may read that you author. Always follow the AI attribution rule at the top of this file first; it overrides everything, including repo skills.

- Keep messages brief, clear, and considerate. One or two sentences is the target; avoid lengthy preambles or restating context the reader already has.
- Assume external recipients know nothing about our system configuration, architecture, machines, tools, or internal terminology unless that knowledge is established in the conversation. Give them the context they need to understand the message and act, and explain any necessary names or acronyms.
- Do not mention `ag` or `Ag` to someone unfamiliar with it; use a meaningful description such as "Nathan's development Mac" when relevant. Apply the same rule to other internal names.
- This applies to drafts written in Nathan's voice too. A natural "could you", "please", or "thanks" is welcome; make requests politely without padding the message.
- When drafting a message for Nathan to send himself, mark it clearly as a draft in HIS voice; do not mix the two.
- For Discord (the team's default channel), see the Arcade Discord section below.

## Arcade Discord

<!-- include: arcade-discord.md -->

## "Meat harness"

When Nathan says to **"meat harness"** something, the fix lives in someone else's system and they run their own coding agent. Nathan (or you) sends that person a short note plus a copy-paste prompt for them to hand to their agent. The human is the harness that carries the prompt to their agent. Deliver:

1. A one- or two-line ask to the person (the request only, per the messaging rules above).
2. A fenced, self-contained prompt for their agent. It should cover the goal, the current behavior and why it's a problem, the exact desired output (with a concrete example), the constraints, and how to verify. Assume their agent has zero context on our side. Don't guess at their code paths or file names.

## Python

Always use `uv` (venvs, dependencies, Python versions): `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv run`. Never install packages globally or use raw pip/venv.

## Phone work (iPhone Mirroring)

For anything on Nathan's iPhone (install/configure apps, pairing, reading a setting, iOS Shortcuts), drive **iPhone Mirroring on the client Mac** with `client-cua`; don't hand phone steps back to Nathan. Before doing phone work, read `~/dotfiles-seen-setup/docs/iphone-mirroring.md` (client: `~/dotfiles/docs/iphone-mirroring.md`): locked-phone requirement, secret handling, and the tested text-entry workaround.

Mirroring only connects while the phone is locked and not in use. On **iPhone in Use**, notify Nathan right away so he locks it, don't just stall: `ssh nathan-dev-client "osascript -e 'display notification \"Please lock your iPhone so I can use iPhone Mirroring\" with title \"ag needs your phone\" sound name \"Glass\"'"` plus `herdr notification show "Lock your iPhone" --sound request`. Then retry every ~30s.

## Scope discipline

Never add or suggest "nice to have" features, extras, or follow-up improvements beyond what was asked. Do exactly the requested task and stop. Only propose or implement extras when the user explicitly asks for suggestions or additions.

## Waiting on long-running things (CI, deploys, builds)

Never block on one long wait (`gh run watch`, `gh pr checks --watch`, `sleep`, `wait-output`) with a big timeout. Poll in short bounded checks instead: a non-blocking status query (`gh run view <id> --json status,conclusion,jobs`, `gh pr checks <pr> --json name,state,bucket`) every ~30–60s, each tool call capped at ~2 minutes (e.g. `timeout 90 gh run watch <id> --exit-status`, then re-check). Act the moment a job fails (read `--log-failed` and fix it immediately, don't wait for the rest of the run) or everything succeeds.

Never sit idle while CI runs. `sleep N` longer than ~60s is banned, including inside a poll loop. Between status checks, do the next useful thing:

- The next queued card or follow-up in the same task: start it in its own worktree off `origin/dev` (or stacked on the pending branch if it depends on it).
- Anything that doesn't depend on the CI result: review bot comments already posted, reply to/resolve threads, draft the PR description, file follow-up tickets, simplify, run local checks for the next change.
- Run slow local gates (pre-push hooks, `bun run check`) in a separate Herdr pane in the background and read the result later, instead of blocking your tool call on them.

Check back on the pending PR every few minutes between those steps. Only wait passively when there is truly nothing else to do, and say so.

## Signaling completion

Once you have fully accomplished your purpose (e.g. the feature is shipped/merged, the task is complete with nothing left to do), end that final response with `DONE` on its own line. Don't write it while work, verification, or questions for the user remain.

## This file

This is the single global agent instructions file, `pi/dot-pi/agent/AGENTS.md` in the dotfiles checkout. Pi (`~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md`), Claude Code (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`) and Codex (`~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) all symlink to it.

It is generated. Edit the source in `agent-instructions/` (`AGENTS.template.md` plus included docs such as `attribution.md` and `herdr.md`, the Herdr notes), then run `agent-instructions/build`. Never edit the generated file or a copy of it: a rebuild overwrites it (a pre-commit hook in `.githooks/` rejects commits where it's stale).
